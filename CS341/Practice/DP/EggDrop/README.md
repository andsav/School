Given n eggs and k floors, determine the minimum number of trials necessary to determine which floors are safe to drop eggs from.

* All eggs are the same
* An egg that survives the fall can be reused
* If an egg breaks from floor i, it will break from floor j>i
* If an egg doesn't break from floor j, it will not break from floor i<j
