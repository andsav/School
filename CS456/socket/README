How to run
-----------

`./server.sh <req_code>`

`./client.sh <server_hostname> <n_port> <req_code> <message>`

Tested on machines
-------------------

* ubuntu1404-004
* ubuntu1404-006

It should work whether client and server are on the same machines or on different machines (as long as it is the same network)
